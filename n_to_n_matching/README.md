## Data structure

## Where to track a person is assigned to specific date with a role?

- A `WorkDate` instance, which defines the requirements for a date, can accomodate info such as the number of persons per role that are assigned to the date.
- A `PersonPlayer` instance, separately from `WorkDate`, tracks all the dates that s/he is assigned to.
